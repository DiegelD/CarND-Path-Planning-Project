## Conclusion
In the following you will find the development of an **intelligent high way pilot**.
That performs optimized lane changing, means the car only changes into a lane that improves its forward progress.

 *In the following are some highlights of the project described. For deeper, wider more detailed insights feel free to check the code that speaks for itself*.

## Intro Behaviour Planer
One of the most challening topics for the self driving cars. The heard of it is a finite State Machine that govern the complexity of the driving care. Here its not about what exact input for the steering angle we are given its more about
on the macrscopiclevel whether its a left or right or change lanes of a highway or take a exit.

*Personal Note, after you understand a "Behaviour Planer" you will never look at you owen drive skill the same level as before*

Figure below, shows the full interactions of a behovoir Planer. With the control flows and the update times. The green box markes the areas of a Path-Planner. To enable me to focus just on this topic, all the other functions outside the box are provided by Udacity and 
briefly descibed in chapter 5.

## 2) Prediction


In the `Car.cpp` file the function **generate_predictions** takes in the data `[ id, x, y, vx, vy, s, d]`for each detected car from the provided sensorfiusion (detailed inforamtion chapter 4).
Out of this data it calculates the current **velocity**, **lane** and predicts the further non-ego **position**. This is importend, since we need to know at which position the
non-ego vehicles will be, when the ego vehicle is able execute new maneuvers.

* vx: Non ego cars velocity [m/s] in gobal maps x direction.
* vy: Non ego cars velocity [m/s] in gobal maps y direction.

velocity calculation of non ege vehicles in `Car.cpp` line `403`.
```c
double check_speed = sqrt(vx * vx + vy * vy);
```
For the beginning a very simple model base approach is used to predict the non-ego vehicle position at the time the ego vehicle finished the quing waypoint and can execute the 
new waypoints.

* prev_size:  represents the waypoint for the ego vehicle that are queing. 
* 0.2:  5Hz is the run time of the programm. 

predicts further position in `Car.cpp` line `407`.
```c
 check_car_s += ((double)prev_size * .02 * check_speed);
```

## 2) Behavior Planer / Costfunctions 

For an better understanding of the Behavior planer the control the requirmend functionality are displayed in fuigre 2.1. Inside the green box, are the functionalities taht are implemnted
in this project.

The hearth of the `Behaviour` function are the costfunctions, which are calculating the best behaviour for the current vehicle state. 
The chellange in gernal for cost functions are to define the right amout of functions and adjust them so that the desired behaviour is reached. 
For this project following four are implemented:

### inefficenty_cost
The single most imported cost function. 
Cost becomes higher for trajectories with intened lane and final lane, that have traffic slower than traget speed.

*proposed_speed_intended* = Intended line speed
*proposed_speed_final*    = Last line speed 
*car.target_speed*        = Target Speed. In our case 49.5mph

in `Cost.cpp`line `81`.
 ```c
float cost = (2.0 * car.target_speed - proposed_speed_intended - proposed_speed_final) / car.target_speed;
```
### distance to goal
The cost increases with both the distance of intended lane from the goal and the distance of the final lane from the goal. The cost of being out 
of the goal lane also becomes larger as the vehicle approaches the goal.

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.image?\dpi{130}&space;cost=1-e^{-\frac{\left&space;|&space;\Delta&space;d&space;\right|}{\Delta&space;s})

* Intended lane: the intended lane for the given behavior. For PLCR, PLCL, LCR, and LCL, this would be the one lane over from the current lane.
* Final lane: the immediate resulting lane of the given behavior. For LCR and LCL, this would be one lane over.
* Î”s distance to the goal.
* The goal lane.


in `Cost.cpp`line `42 & 46`.
 ```c
int delta_d = 2.0 * car.goal_lane - data["intended_lane"] - data["final_lane"];
cost = 1 - 2 * exp(-(abs(delta_d) / distance));
```
### offroad_cost
During the devlopment stage, the ego car left the desired path to dirve off road. Since there is never traffic jam. To penalize this behavoir 
all paths that will leave the road will get and enormous cost.

* lane_max: Are the lanes that allowed to drive

in `Cost.cpp`line `111`.
```c
  if ((data["intended_lane"] <= car.lane_max) && (data["intended_lane"] >= car.lane_min)) 
    {
      cost = 0;
    }
  else 
  {
    cost = 1;
  }
```
### change_lange_cost
An other problem during the development occurt. The ego vehicle changed wildly the lane, because other lanes hat a marginal velocity advantages. 
To avoid this behaviour and just change the lanes due to a greater velocity advantage this function got introduced. 

in `Cost.cpp`line `146`.
```c
  if ((data["intended_lane"] <= car.lane_max) && (data["intended_lane"] >= car.lane_min))
  {
    cost = 0;
  }
  else
  {
    cost = 1;
  }
```
### Velocity control
To control the velocity and max. acceleration of the vehicle a pritty nice and simple calculatio is used. 
On the first step the new max velocity is set to ensure an cofortable aceleration and decelreation smaller `10m/s^2`.
```c
double max_velocity_accel_limit = this->max_acceleration + this->v;
```

```c
double max_velocity_in_front = (vehicle_ahead.s - this->s - this->preferred_buffer) + vehicle_ahead.v - 0.5 * (this->a);
```
```c
new_velocity = std::min(std::min(max_velocity_in_front,
                                 max_velocity_accel_limit),
                                       this->target_speed);
```

## 3) Trajectoryplaner

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories is
http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.
The spline creates a smooth trajectory through given waypoints.  Three waypoints with a distance of `40m` are choosen. This have  profen given the best results between 
smoothnes and accourancy. Lower distances can lead to a too high lateral accerleration, by changing two hihgway lines. And a higher distance leads to an unconsitance path that cant hold the line.
The car.lane represents the desired lane by the behaviour planer.

in `main.cpp`line `182`.
```c
vector<double> next_wp0 = getXY(car.s + 40, (2 + 4 * car.lane), map_waypoints_s, map_waypoints_x, map_waypoints_y);
vector<double> next_wp1 = getXY(car.s + 80, (2 + 4 * car.lane), map_waypoints_s, map_waypoints_x, map_waypoints_y);
vector<double> next_wp2 = getXY(car.s + 120, (2 + 4 * car.lane), map_waypoints_s, map_waypoints_x, map_waypoints_y);
```

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Dicussion:

Trajectorirs replaced by JMT -> Paper


## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
